# UniversalJumpscare
"Yet another jumpscare mod?"

Yep! This one's got GIF support, and can activate any time--even outside of levels!

Customization options range from:
- Image file (PNGs, GIFs, and more!)
- Screen fill mode and/or scale
- Fade out delay + duration
- SFX file + volume
- Whether the jumpscare appears in menus, the level editor, or during actual gameplay
- Ending the jumpscare early whenever entering/exiting the level editor or actual gameplay

Mod suggested by [BRemiTK/RemiliaTK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjjuFe94YbGgT-cpTq0jQXA). "Inspired" by the countless mods for other games that shove Foxy from FNAF2 up in your face.

A moment of silence for [KaydaCant](https://github.com/KaydaCant) and [Expeleo](https://github.com/Expeleo), who made similar attempts before.
