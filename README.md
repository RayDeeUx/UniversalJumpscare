# UniversalJumpscare
"Yet another jumpscare mod?"

Yep! This one's got GIF support, and can activate any time--even outside of levels!

Customization options range from:
- Image file (PNGs, GIFs, and more!)
- Screen fill mode and/or scale
- Fade out delay + duration
- SFX file + volume
- Whether the jumpscare appears in menus, the level editor, or during actual gameplay
- Ending the jumpscare early whenever entering/exiting the level editor or actual gameplay
